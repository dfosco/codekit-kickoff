codekit-unbottle
===============

A scaffolding for use with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). Heavily based on Michael Lesher's [Codekit Kickoff](http://kickoff.thehivemedia.com/).

Unbottle adds to Kickoff the Bitters scaffolding library, to be used alongside Bourbon and Neat, as well as HTML files with Liquid markup.

Even though Codekit does not process Liquid markup, you can run a parallel terminal process to compile the Liquid files. As an example, you can use Liquid to run [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) blogs or develop themes for [Shopify](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme) and [Siteleaf](https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-gem).

Learn more about Liquid in their [Github repository](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid).

## Documentation

Still in the works. For now, you can browse the documentation for the project that this one was based off, [CodeKit Kickoff](http://kickoff.thehivemedia.com).

## Acknowledgement

This project is meant to be used as a framework for CodeKit. It includes jQuery, Font-Awesome, Bitters (and @import's for Bourbon and Neat) as well files using the Liquid templating markup.

To that end, each of these frameworks and libraries have their own Licensing Restrictions. It is your responsibility to be aware of them.
