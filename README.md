codekit-unbottle
===============

A scaffolding for use with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/). Heavily based on Michael Lesher's [Codekit Kickoff](http://kickoff.thehivemedia.com/).

Unbottle adds to Kickoff the Bitters scaffolding library, to be used alongside Bourbon and Neat, as well as HTML files with Liquid markup.

## Documentation

Still in the works. For now, you can browse the documentation for the project that this one was based off, [CodeKit Kickoff](http://kickoff.thehivemedia.com).

## Acknowledgement

This project is meant to be used as a boilerplate for websites using CodeKit. It includes jQuery, Font-Awesome, Bitters (as well as @import's for Bourbon and Neat).

To that end, each of these frameworks and libraries have their own Licensing Restrictions. It is your responsibility to be aware of them.
